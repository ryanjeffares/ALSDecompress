# ALSDecompress
Decompresses Ableton Live Set files and stores the data. Long term the intention is to make some sort of version control system for Ableton projects, but first step is to get the data out of the .als and just re-write into an .als as proof of concept.

This project is now being implemented in C++ at https://github.com/ryanjeffares/avc
